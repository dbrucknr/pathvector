# TODO

Tracked items that are intentionally deferred — known gaps, planned features,
and protocol steps that require components not yet built. Each entry notes
which crate it belongs to and why it was deferred.

---

## General
~~Download Relevant RFC's to each module.~~
~~Generate a list of requirements from the RFC's.~~
~~Check whether or not the each module currently meets these requirements.~~
**Done** — `RFC_REQUIREMENTS.md` tracks every implemented RFC, its requirements, owning module,
implementation status, and verified-by test citations.

### Property testing and fuzz coverage (ordered)

Proptests and fuzzing serve different purposes and should be added in this order:

- **Proptests** prove structural invariants hold for all valid inputs — RFC conformance evidence.
- **Cargo fuzz** proves arbitrary byte input never panics or corrupts state — panic-safety story.

**Phase 1 — `pathvector-session` codec round-trips** ✓ Done
All four message types (OPEN, UPDATE, NOTIFICATION, KEEPALIVE, ROUTE-REFRESH) have round-trip
proptests at both the `BgpMessage::encode/decode` layer (`message/prop_tests.rs`) and the
`BgpCodec` framing layer (`framing/prop_tests.rs`). Full capabilities, path attributes, and all
`NotificationError` sub-families are exercised. `prop_decode_never_panics` covers both layers.
The generators exposed a real round-trip constraint: `Unknown` sub-variants must exclude codes that
the decoder maps to named variants — constrained accordingly.

**Phase 2 — `pathvector-rib` best-path invariants** ✓ Done (2026-06-09)
Step-by-step isolation proptests in `pathvector-rib/src/best_path.rs::prop_tests`:
- `prop_select_best_winner_has_highest_local_pref` — winner LP ≥ all others (step 2)
- `prop_select_best_missing_local_pref_treated_as_100` — None → 100 default (step 2)
- `prop_select_best_winner_has_shortest_as_path` — winner len ≤ all others (step 4)
- `prop_select_best_winner_has_lowest_origin` — winner origin ≤ all others (step 5)
- `prop_select_best_winner_has_lowest_med` — winner MED ≤ all others, None=0 (step 6)
- `prop_select_best_ebgp_beats_ibgp` — eBGP beats iBGP even with lower peer IP (step 7)
- `prop_select_best_lower_peer_ip_wins_on_full_tie` — full-tie tiebreaker (step 10)
- `prop_select_best_non_empty_returns_some`, `prop_select_best_winner_is_in_candidates`
  (structural invariants)
- LocRib, AdjRibIn, and AdjRibOut structural proptests (insert/withdraw/consistency)

**Phase 3 — `pathvector-policy` semantics** ✓ Done
Empty-policy default action, catch-all terms, and all-Next fall-through were already covered.
Added the two remaining plan items:
- `prop_policy_evaluation_is_deterministic`: same route state evaluated twice always produces
  the same decision — rules out hidden mutable state in Policy or its terms.
- `prop_first_match_wins_accept_blocks_later_reject`: a route matched by term N (Accept)
  is never passed to term N+1 (catch-all Reject) — core first-match-wins guarantee.
Also covers 8 action invariants (PrependAsPath, Add/Remove/SetCommunities, SetLocalPref,
AnyCondition, ActionSequence).

**Phase 6 — `pathvector-client` conversion layer fuzz target** (deferred)
The `pathvector-client` crate is a trust boundary — it parses responses from a daemon over
the network, and the daemon could be buggy or compromised. The conversion layer
(`src/convert.rs`) does address parsing from `String`, enum coercion with unknown-value
handling, and fixed-width extended-community byte slicing (8 bytes each). A fuzz target that
generates arbitrary proto-encoded `Route` / `PeerState` bytes and drives the full `TryFrom`
chain would catch panics in these paths. Unlike the codec fuzz targets (which test
adversarial *peer* input), this tests adversarial *daemon* responses — a different attack
surface. Add to `fuzz/fuzz_targets/client_convert.rs` once the proto message structures
stabilise (adding streaming RPCs will change the generated types).

**Phase 4 — `cargo fuzz` on the codec decode path** ✓ Done
Two fuzz targets live in `fuzz/fuzz_targets/` at the workspace root:
- `session_framing` — feeds raw `&[u8]` into `BgpCodec::decode` (the entry point for any remote peer byte stream);
  if the framing layer accepts a frame, the round-trip encode/decode is also exercised.
- `session_message` — patches the 2-byte length field so `BgpMessage::decode` receives a self-consistent
  buffer regardless of the fuzz input, driving the body-parsing paths for all five message types.

Seed corpus (`fuzz/corpus/session_{framing,message}/`) pre-populates valid KEEPALIVE, OPEN (minimal and
with 4-byte ASN capability), NOTIFICATION, UPDATE, and ROUTE-REFRESH examples so the fuzzer
starts from real message boundaries rather than discovering the `0xFF×16` marker pattern cold.

Both targets compile clean under nightly and ran ~3M executions / 16 seconds with zero panics on
first smoke run. Run via the Justfile from the workspace root:

```sh
just fuzz-smoke     # 60 s smoke run of both targets
just fuzz-framing   # extended run until Ctrl-C
just fuzz-message   # extended run until Ctrl-C
```

See TESTING.md for the full explanation of the nightly/Homebrew PATH issue and crash reproduction.

**Phase 5 — `pathvector-e2e` Docker-based end-to-end suite** ✓ Done (2026-06-09)
Both gobgpd and pathvectord run as Linux containers on an isolated Docker bridge network
per test. BGP (port 179) is container-to-container — the macOS Docker Desktop TCP proxy
never touches it. Only pathvectord's gRPC port is mapped to the host for `PathvectorClient`.

Infrastructure committed on branch `e2e` (commit `19a8605`):
- `e2e/Dockerfile` — GoBGP 4.6.0 Alpine image (Linux arm64/amd64, no macOS prebuilt needed)
- `e2e/Dockerfile.pathvectord` — multi-stage Rust build; debian:bookworm-slim runtime
- `e2e/docker-compose.yml` — manual dev environment with fixed `172.20.0.0/24` subnet
- `e2e/src/lib.rs` — `Harness` using testcontainers-rs 0.23; per-test `docker network create/rm`;
  `docker inspect` for container IP; `docker exec` for gobgp CLI

20 tests passing across 4 files:
- `routes.rs` (6): `announced_route_appears_in_rib`, `list_candidates_returns_peer_route`,
  `multiple_routes_all_installed`, `partial_withdrawal_leaves_others_intact`,
  `unknown_prefix_returns_none`, `withdrawn_route_removed_from_rib`
- `session.rs` (6): `list_peers_includes_gobgp_peer`, `peer_state_fields_correct_after_established`,
  `session_reaches_established`, `wait_for_established_respects_deadline`,
  `wait_for_route_respects_deadline`, `wait_for_route_withdrawn_respects_deadline`
- `outbound.rs` (4): `announced_route_propagates_to_sink`, `multiple_routes_all_propagate_to_sink`,
  `withdrawn_route_removed_from_sink`, `source_route_visible_in_pathvectord_rib`
- `policy.rs` (4): `no_import_policy_rejects_ebgp_prefix`, `explicit_import_accept_installs_ebgp_prefix`,
  `no_export_policy_suppresses_advertisement_to_peer`, `explicit_export_accept_propagates_to_sink`

Remaining e2e work:
- **Outbound advertisement tests** — **Done (2026-06-09).** Two-peer topology:
  GoBGP-source (AS 65003) → pathvectord (AS 65002) → GoBGP-sink (AS 65001).
  `TwoPeerHarness` in `e2e/src/lib.rs`; four tests in `e2e/tests/outbound.rs`
  cover: single prefix propagation, multi-prefix, withdrawal, and management-API
  visibility. `write_daemon_config` generalized to accept a slice of peers.
- **Import/export-policy reject tests (RFC 8212)** — **Done (2026-06-09).**
  `Harness::new_rfc8212()` configures pathvectord with no policy on the peer;
  `TwoPeerHarness::new_no_export_policy()` configures import-accept + no export.
  Four tests in `e2e/tests/policy.rs` prove both directions: routes are blocked
  without an explicit policy and flow correctly with one.
- Adversarial inputs — malformed BGP messages injected directly over TCP to verify the
  daemon handles them gracefully without panicking
- **GitHub Actions e2e workflow** — **Done (2026-06-09).** Separate `e2e` job in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on `ubuntu-latest` (Docker pre-installed). Uses
  `docker/setup-buildx-action` + `docker/build-push-action` with `type=gha` layer
  caching (separate scopes for `gobgpd` and `pathvectord` images). GoBGP image is a
  cache hit on repeat runs. `test` and `msrv` jobs now pass `--exclude pathvector-e2e`
  so the crate is not exercised without its required images. A `.githooks/pre-push` hook
  (installed via `just install-hooks`) runs `just e2e` locally before each push.
- **BIRD interoperability** — add a second peer implementation. BIRD is stricter about RFC
  compliance than GoBGP (it's the reference implementation for many IXP route servers) and
  will catch things GoBGP tolerates. A `e2e/Dockerfile.bird` wrapping the official BIRD
  package + `e2e/fixtures/bird.conf` is all that's needed; the `Harness` architecture already
  supports multiple peer images. Target: run the same 10 session + route tests against BIRD
  to confirm the handshake and UPDATE exchange is broadly interoperable, not just GoBGP-specific.

## pathvector-rib

### Best-path selection — missing decision steps

RFC 4271 §9.1 defines a 10-step decision process. The current implementation
covers steps 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10. The remaining steps are deferred because
they require information the RIB layer does not yet have.

| Step | Criterion | Blocked on |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Prefer routes with a reachable next-hop | IGP integration — the RIB needs to know which next-hops are reachable via the interior routing protocol |
| 3 | Prefer locally originated routes | Peer session type — the RIB needs to know whether a route was originated locally (`network` statement) vs learned from a peer |
| 8 | Prefer lowest IGP metric to next-hop | IGP integration — requires the router's own IGP topology view |
| 9 | Prefer oldest eBGP route | Route age tracking — the RIB would need to record when each route was first received |

### Longest-prefix-match queries

**Done.** `LocRib::best` now uses `RouteMap<A, (PeerId, Route<A>)>` (routemap 0.1.2)
instead of `HashMap`. `LocRib::longest_match(addr: A)` exposes O(log n) LPM
for forwarding lookups. Exact-prefix queries (`best`, `best_peer`) use the new
`RouteMap::get` added in routemap 0.1.2.

### Multi-path (ECMP)

Best-path selection currently picks exactly one winner. BGP ECMP
(equal-cost multi-path) allows multiple routes to be installed simultaneously
when their path cost is equal up to and including step 8. Requires a
`MultiPath` variant in the best-route representation and configuration to
enable (`maximum-paths` knob).

### Route reflector support

Intra-cluster route reflection (RFC 4456) requires the RIB to track:
- `ORIGINATOR_ID` (type 9) — the router-id of the originating route reflector client
- `CLUSTER_LIST` (type 10) — the sequence of cluster IDs the route has passed through

Loop prevention in a route reflector topology uses these attributes instead
of (or in addition to) the AS path.

### Configurable MED behaviour

The current implementation treats missing MED as `0`. Real implementations
offer:
- `always-compare-med` — compare MED even when routes come from different ASes
- `deterministic-med` — group routes by originating AS before comparing MED,
  ensuring the same best path is chosen regardless of route arrival order
- Configurable missing-MED treatment (`0`, `u32::MAX`, or policy-set)

---

## pathvector-session

### Done

- Message codec: OPEN, UPDATE, KEEPALIVE, NOTIFICATION, ROUTE-REFRESH
- NLRI parser: variable-length prefix encoding for IPv4 and IPv6
- MP_REACH_NLRI / MP_UNREACH_NLRI for multiprotocol routes
- 4-byte ASN capability — codec encoding/decoding, `AS_TRANS` substitution in FSM, `AS4_PATH` / `AS4_AGGREGATOR` handling
- Graceful Restart and Route Refresh capability — codec parsing and encoding
- BGP FSM: Idle → Connect → Active → OpenSent → OpenConfirm → Established (pure state machine, no I/O)
- Codec error logging in transport — `recv_message` errors are now surfaced via `tracing::warn!` before dropping the connection
- **GoBGP interoperability validated (2026-05-31)** — full session lifecycle confirmed: OPEN negotiation, KEEPALIVE exchange, UPDATE announce and withdraw, session teardown
- **Outbound UPDATE send path (2026-06-01)** — `SessionHandle::update_sender()` returns a cloneable `mpsc::Sender<UpdateMessage>`. `wait_for_input()` wraps its `select!` in a `loop` with a lowest-priority arm that writes outbound UPDATEs directly to the TCP framer inline; write failures return `TcpFailed` to the FSM for clean recovery.

### Remaining

- MD5 authentication (RFC 2385) — TCP-MD5 socket option for eBGP peering
- BGP-SEC (RFC 8205) — cryptographic path validation; further out, but worth noting alongside MD5 as the broader authentication story
- Connection collision detection — when both peers dial simultaneously, the router with the higher BGP ID keeps its outbound connection; FSM has the `bgp_id` field but no collision logic
- Graceful Restart FSM behaviour (RFC 4724) — capability is parsed and forwarded in `SessionInfo`, but the FSM does not yet act on it (hold forwarding state, stale route timer)

### Panic safety — replace `expect()` in `build_session_info`

**Done.** `build_session_info` now returns `Option<SessionInfo>`. The `on_open_confirm`
Keepalive arm uses `let...else`: on `None` it logs `tracing::error!`, resets the FSM
to Idle, and returns `[StopHoldTimer, StopKeepaliveTimer, CloseTcpConnection]` — the
same clean teardown as a normal failure, without panicking or leaving stale routes.
Covered by `test_keepalive_in_open_confirm_with_missing_peer_open_resets_to_idle`.

### Transport layer mocking via `BgpTransport` trait — **Done**

`BgpTransport` is a public trait (RPITIT + `+ Send` bounds) in `transport/mod.rs`.
`FramedBgpTransport` is the production impl wrapping `FramedRead`/`FramedWrite` over TCP.
`Session<T: BgpTransport>` is generic; `spawn()` stays non-generic (`Session<FramedBgpTransport>`).
`spawn_with<T: BgpTransport>` (`#[cfg(test)]`) injects a pre-built transport; the first
`InitiateTcpConnect` output activates it and queues `TcpConnected` via `pending_input`,
bypassing real TCP. Two previously-uncovered write-failure paths are now covered:
- `test_send_failure_in_execute_triggers_tcp_failed_recovery` — OPEN send fails before
  Established; `execute` returns false, `run` feeds `TcpFailed`.
- `test_outbound_update_write_failure_emits_terminated` — UPDATE write fails after
  Established; the UPDATE arm in `wait_for_input` returns `TcpFailed`, teardown emits
  `Terminated`.

---

## pathvector-bmp

Not yet started. Key work items:

- BMP receiver (RFC 7854): Route Monitoring, Stats Reports, Peer Up/Down messages
- Route Monitoring NLRI → `Route<A>` → `AdjRibIn` pipeline
- Per-peer RIB view reconstruction from BMP stream

---

## pathvectord

### Done

- TOML configuration: `local_as`, `bgp_id`, `hold_time`, per-peer `address`/`port`/`remote_as`
- Session spawning: one `transport::spawn()` task per configured peer, events multiplexed into a single channel
- RIB integration: `UpdateMessage` → `Route<Ipv4Addr>` conversion, `LocRib` insert/withdraw/peer-teardown
- Structured logging via `tracing` with `RUST_LOG` env-filter support
- **GoBGP interoperability validated (2026-05-31)**
- **Outbound advertisement path (2026-06-01)** — pathvectord is now a full BGP speaker:
  - `ExportDefault` config enum and per-peer `export_default` field (mirrors `import_default`)
  - Per-peer export policies evaluated via `propagate_prefix` before `AdjRibOut` insertion
  - `prepare_outbound` applies eBGP attribute transforms: prepend local AS to `AS_PATH`, rewrite `NEXT_HOP` to local BGP ID, strip `LOCAL_PREF`
  - `route_to_update` / `withdraw_msg` serialise `AdjRibOut` changes to wire-format `UpdateMessage`
  - On `Established`: `AdjRibOut` reset to clean slate, full-table dump to the new peer
  - On `RouteUpdate`: affected NLRIs propagated to all established peers after `handle_update`
  - On `Terminated`: snapshot-before-withdraw pattern propagates best-path changes to other established peers; `AdjRibOut` reset for clean reconnect
  - Idempotent: `propagate_prefix` compares new route against what is already in `AdjRibOut` and sends UPDATE/WITHDRAW only when the advertised state actually changes

### Remaining

- **Panic safety in main event loop — Done.** All `expect()` calls in `run()` replaced with
  `let...else` + `tracing::error!` + `continue`. Unknown peer IPs now log an error and skip
  the event rather than panicking the daemon.

- Soft reconfiguration → export propagation — `reapply_import_policy` changes which routes
  are in `LocRib`, but does not currently trigger `propagate_prefix` to update peers. Callers
  that perform policy reloads must trigger outbound propagation manually until this is wired.

- IPv6 in the daemon — the session layer already speaks IPv6 via MP_REACH_NLRI, but
  `pathvectord` is hardcoded to `Route<Ipv4Addr>`. Extending to IPv6 requires a
  dual-stack RIB or a generic event dispatch on address family.
  **IPv4 MP path done (2026-06-08):** `handle_update` now processes `MP_UNREACH_NLRI`
  and `MP_REACH_NLRI` attributes for AFI/SAFI=IPv4 unicast. Peers that send IPv4
  withdrawals or announcements via the multiprotocol attributes instead of the
  traditional fields are handled correctly. Non-IPv4 AFI/SAFIs are logged at DEBUG
  and skipped. Full IPv6 RIB support still requires the dual-stack work above.

- gRPC management API — **Done (2026-06-08).** `PeerService` and `RibService` are live on a configurable port (default 50051). Proto schema at `proto/pathvector/v1/management.proto`. See [DAEMON.md](DAEMON.md) for the full operational guide and `grpcurl` query examples. Remaining: policy introspection and runtime policy reload (blocked on wiring `reapply_import_policy` to export propagation).
- gRPC server reflection — **Done (2026-06-08).** `tonic-reflection` registered at startup. `grpcurl` now works without `--proto` flags; `grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 list` discovers all services at runtime.
- Import policy — **Done.** `handle_update` now evaluates a `Policy<Route<Ipv4Addr>>` per route before `LocRib::insert`; routes that return `Reject` are dropped. Per-peer default action (`import_default = "accept"` / `"reject"`) is configurable in TOML; eBGP peers default to `"reject"` (RFC 8212) when omitted, iBGP peers default to `"accept"`. The infrastructure is in place for adding `Term` conditions (prefix lists, community filters, etc.).
- BLACKHOLE community discard action (RFC 7999) — `Community::BLACKHOLE` (0xFFFF029A) is defined and detectable via `is_blackhole()`, but there is no null-route or discard action wired in the RIB or daemon; routes tagged with BLACKHOLE should have traffic to their prefix dropped at the forwarding plane
- `AdjRibIn` — **Done.** Per-peer `AdjRibIn` tables are built at startup and wired through `handle_update`. Raw (pre-policy) routes are stored on every announcement; withdrawals remove from both `AdjRibIn` and `LocRib`; session teardown calls `AdjRibIn::clear()`. `reapply_import_policy` re-evaluates all stored raw routes against a new policy, inserting accepted routes and withdrawing rejected ones from `LocRib` without a session reset.
- CLI binary (`pathvector`) using the gRPC client
- **Docker image** — **Done (2026-06-09).** `e2e/Dockerfile.pathvectord` is a multi-stage build:
  `rust:1.88-slim-bookworm` builder (with `protobuf-compiler`), `debian:bookworm-slim` runtime
  (with `netcat-openbsd` for HEALTHCHECK). Config file is bind-mounted at container start.
  gRPC port 51200 is exposed and mapped dynamically by testcontainers. Built via `just e2e-images`.

---

## pathvector-client

**Done (2026-06-08).** Self-contained gRPC client library for the `pathvectord`
management API. No dependency on any internal `pathvector-*` crate — all domain
types are defined independently in `src/types.rs`.

### Done

- `PathvectorClient::connect(addr)` — lazy channel construction; no async required
- `list_peers()`, `get_peer(addr)` — full `PeerState` conversion from proto
- `get_best_route(prefix)` → `Option<Route>`, `list_routes(peer_filter)`, `list_candidates(prefix)`
- `TryFrom` conversion layer (`src/convert.rs`) with explicit error variants:
  `InvalidAddress`, `UnknownEnumValue`, `BadExtendedCommunityLen`
- Three error types: `ConnectError`, `ClientError`, `ConvertError` — all with
  `Display`, `Error::source`, and `From` impls; no `thiserror`
- 83 unit tests (including 10 proptest properties) + 12 integration tests driven
  by an in-process mock gRPC server; all pass under `just ci` (MSRV 1.88)
- Optional `serde` feature flag on all domain types

### Remaining

- `serde` feature: `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derives are gated but not yet
  implemented on the domain types (blocked on deciding JSON schema conventions)
- Policy introspection RPC (`ListTerms`, `EvalRoute`) — blocked on
  `reapply_import_policy` being wired to export propagation in `pathvectord`

### gRPC streaming watch RPCs

The current management API is purely request/response — operators and tests must poll to
observe changes. Adding server-side streaming RPCs would make the API event-driven:

```protobuf
rpc WatchRoutes(WatchRoutesRequest) returns (stream RouteEvent);
rpc WatchPeers(WatchPeersRequest)  returns (stream PeerEvent);
```

Where `RouteEvent` carries `oneof { Route announced = 1; string withdrawn_prefix = 2; }`
and `PeerEvent` carries the updated `PeerState`.

Benefits:
- **e2e tests** — replace `wait_for_route` polling loops with an event-driven subscription;
  tests become faster and have no arbitrary sleep timeouts
- **CLI** — `pathvector watch routes` / `pathvector watch peers` become natural commands
- **Operators** — live monitoring without external polling scripts

Implementation touches: proto schema, daemon event fan-out (the session event channel
already carries all the information — each watch stream registers as a receiver), and the
client library (`watch_routes() -> impl Stream<Item = RouteEvent>`). The daemon side
requires careful backpressure handling: a slow watch client must not block the main loop.
Consider a bounded broadcast channel per watch stream with the oldest entry dropped on
overflow (same pattern as Tokio's `broadcast::channel`).

---

## Cross-cutting

### Architecture overview document

**Done (2026-06-09).** `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the workspace root covers:
- Crate dependency graph with rationale for `pathvector-client` having no internal deps
- Full inbound route path: TCP socket → codec → FSM → SessionEvent → DaemonState →
  AdjRibIn → import policy → LocRib
- Full outbound route path: LocRib best-path change → propagate_prefix → export policy →
  AdjRibOut → outbound UPDATE channel → Session → TCP socket
- Session lifecycle events table (Established / Terminated / RouteUpdate)
- Management plane: Arc<RwLock<DaemonState>>, read/write lock split rationale
- BgpTransport trait seam and how spawn_with injects a mock transport in tests
- DaemonState owns no I/O — all side effects flow through mpsc channels
- Key design invariants (pure FSM, zero-dep types, idempotent propagate_prefix, etc.)

### Logging audit

The current `tracing` usage grew organically and needs a systematic review:

1. **Structured fields** — every log site should include typed fields rather than string
   interpolation. The convention should be `peer_addr = %addr` (Display) and
   `prefix = %prefix` consistently across all crates.
2. **Per-session spans** — each session task should be instrumented with a `tracing::span!`
   carrying `peer_addr` and `local_as` so that log output can be filtered per-peer without
   grepping. Currently logs from concurrent sessions are interleaved without a key.
3. **Level discipline** — establish and enforce:
   - `ERROR`: logic invariants violated (should never happen); always actionable
   - `WARN`: expected-but-bad external input (malformed message, peer misbehaviour)
   - `INFO`: operator-relevant lifecycle events (session established/terminated, route count changes)
   - `DEBUG`: per-message events useful for tracing protocol state
   - `TRACE`: raw byte-level detail; acceptable performance cost only in debug builds
4. **Hot paths** — the UPDATE processing path (`handle_update` → `LocRib::insert` →
   `propagate_prefix`) runs for every route change. Verify no `INFO`-or-above log sites
   sit inside the inner loop without rate-limiting.

### Result/Option return type audit

Any function that can fail should say so in its return type. Conduct a systematic pass:

1. **`expect()` / `unwrap()` survivors** — grep the entire workspace for `expect(` and
   `unwrap()` outside of `#[cfg(test)]` blocks; each one is either a legitimate invariant
   (document why it cannot fail) or should be replaced with a `Result` return and `?`.
2. **`()` returns that can fail silently** — functions returning `()` that perform I/O or
   parse input should return `Result<(), E>` and let the caller decide how to handle failure.
   The gRPC handler functions are the highest-risk area here.
3. **gRPC error propagation** — verify that every `tonic::Status` returned from a handler
   carries a meaningful `code` and `message`. An internal conversion error that maps to
   `Status::internal("unknown error")` is opaque to the caller; it should include the
   original error in the message.
4. **`ConvertError` completeness** — the `pathvector-client` conversion layer has explicit
   error variants. Verify no `unwrap()` or `expect()` hides inside any `TryFrom` impl.

- CI pipeline: `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo doc`, MSRV check (1.88) — **Done.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has five jobs: `test` (stable), `lint` (clippy + rustfmt, stable), `msrv` (1.88), `docs` (stable, `-D warnings`), and `fuzz` (nightly, `just fuzz-smoke`). A `Justfile` at the workspace root provides matching local recipes so CI and development use the same commands. All jobs install `protoc` (required by `pathvectord`'s gRPC codegen build script).
- Integration test isolation — `tests/transport.rs` binds real loopback TCP sockets; these tests are excellent for correctness but will be slow and port-conflict-prone on shared CI runners; consider a `#[cfg(not(ci))]` guard or dedicated test binary with a randomised port range
- Fuzz testing — tracked as Phase 4 in the property testing section above

### Performance

#### Known architectural concerns

These are structural decisions in the current implementation worth measuring before
deciding whether to address them. All are acceptable at small peer counts and RIB
sizes; they become bottlenecks at internet scale (tens of peers, ~950k IPv4 prefixes).

1. ~~**`try_send` failure on the outbound UPDATE channel**~~ — **Fixed (2026-06-09).**
   `propagate_prefix` now returns `bool`; a `false` return means the channel was full.
   The three `DaemonState` event methods collect stalled peers into `self.stalled_peers`.
   After each event, `run()` sends `SessionCommand::Stop` to each stalled session via a
   retained `stop_senders` map (populated from a new `SessionHandle::stop_sender()`
   method). The session re-establishes and `on_established` performs a fresh full-table
   dump from a clean `AdjRibOut`, restoring a consistent peer view. Overflow is logged
   at `ERROR`. Tests updated from "does not panic" to "returns false" assertions.

2. **Single event loop for all peers** — all peer sessions funnel into one `mpsc` channel;
   `DaemonState` processes events sequentially under a write lock. A large UPDATE from one
   peer (e.g., a full-table session establishment) blocks event processing for every other
   peer for the duration, creating hold-timer pressure at high peer counts. Sharding
   `DaemonState` by address family or introducing a per-peer processing pipeline would fix
   this, but requires significant ownership rework.

3. **No NLRI batching in outbound UPDATEs** — each affected prefix generates its own
   `UpdateMessage` and wire frame. RFC 4271 allows packing multiple NLRIs with identical
   path attributes into a single UPDATE. Batching reduces TCP segment count and framing
   overhead, which matters most during full-table dumps to newly established peers.

4. **Full-table dump on peer establishment holds the write lock** — `on_established`
   iterates the entire `LocRib` and calls `propagate_prefix` for every best route before
   releasing the write lock. At ~950k routes this is a multi-millisecond stall that blocks
   both the BGP event loop and all concurrent gRPC reads. Fix: generate the dump
   asynchronously, releasing the lock between batches.

#### Per-crate criterion benchmarks

Each crate should have a `benches/` directory with criterion benchmarks. The goal is
a stable baseline on M2 Max hardware that can detect regressions as the implementation
evolves. Suggested targets:

| Crate | Benchmark | What to measure |

#### System-level benchmarks against GoBGP and BIRD

Measuring the end-to-end convergence time and memory footprint of a real BGP speaker
under a realistic internet-scale prefix load requires a traffic generator.
**[ExaBGP](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp)** is the standard tool: it is a
Python BGP implementation that can replay MRT dumps as a BGP UPDATE stream, acting as
a fully conformant peer. MRT dump files from [RouteViews](http://www.routeviews.org/)
or [RIPE RIS](https://ris.ripe.net/dumps/) provide real internet routing tables
(~950k IPv4 prefixes as of 2026).

**Proposed benchmark scenario:**

1. Stand up ExaBGP (or a dedicated `exabgp` Docker container) configured to replay a
   full RouteViews MRT dump toward a single DUT (device under test).
2. Measure from the moment BGP `Established` is reached:
   - **Convergence time** — seconds from first UPDATE to RIB stable (no new best-path
     changes for 5 consecutive seconds)
   - **Peak RSS** — resident set size at the end of the full-table load
   - **Steady-state CPU** — CPU% after convergence with periodic keepalives only
   - **Hold-timer health** — did any KEEPALIVE interval slip during the flood?
3. Run the same scenario against GoBGP 4.x and BIRD 2.x on the same hardware with
   equivalent configuration (one eBGP peer, accept-all import policy).

**Docker composition** — the same testcontainers architecture used in the e2e suite
applies here. A `bench/` crate (or a standalone binary) could:
- Start an `exabgp` container serving the MRT dump
- Start the DUT container (pathvectord / gobgpd / bird)
- Poll via gRPC (pathvectord) or CLI (gobgp/birdc) until RIB prefix count stabilises
- Record wall-clock time, RSS (`docker stats --no-stream`), CPU

**Prerequisites before this is actionable:**
- NLRI batching (concern #3 above) should be addressed first so outbound performance
  is not artificially penalised
- The full-table dump lock-hold (concern #4) should be measured separately from the
  inbound convergence benchmark
- A RouteViews MRT dump needs to be converted to ExaBGP's `announce` format (the
  `exabgp-mrt` tool does this); the converted file should be committed to `bench/fixtures/`
  (or downloaded by the benchmark harness to avoid repo bloat)
